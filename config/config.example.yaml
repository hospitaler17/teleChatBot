# teleChatBot Configuration
# Copy this file to config.yaml and adjust to your needs.

# Mistral model settings
mistral:
  # Default model - used as fallback for simple queries when dynamic selection 
  # doesn't detect code, complexity, images, or long context.
  # The bot will automatically select the most appropriate model based on your query:
  # - Simple questions → uses this default model (fast)
  # - Code-related queries → codestral-latest
  # - Complex reasoning → mistral-large-latest
  # - Image analysis → pixtral-12b-latest
  model: "mistral-small-latest"
  max_tokens: 1024
  temperature: 0.7
  # Optional system prompt to define the assistant's behavior and role
  # Leave empty or remove to use no system prompt
  system_prompt: ""
  # Example: "Ты - полезный ассистент, который отвечает кратко и по делу."
  # Enable web search with multi-provider fallback:
  # 1. Google Custom Search (if API key provided) - best quality
  # 2. SearXNG public instance - reliable fallback
  # 3. DuckDuckGo - last resort
  enable_web_search: true
  # Number of previous message pairs to keep in conversation history
  # Each pair = 1 user message + 1 bot response
  # Larger values = more context but higher API token usage
  # Set to 0 to disable conversation history

# Bot behavior

  # Enable streaming: Send responses progressively as they're generated
  # Provides better user experience for long responses
  enable_streaming: true
  # Minimum response length (in characters) to trigger streaming
